10/10- Beer is always a good angle :) Also good thoughtful discussion of the pros and cons of each of your scenarios.

# Submission notes
The Advocacy_setup-final.ipynb contains the code for the crop change. The Advocacy_setup-well_final.ipynb contains the well move code and the code for both changes.

The plotting code in plotting_advocacy-final.ipynb contains the code to plot the crop change and well move. A new code was created in plotting_advocacy-bw.ipynb to plot both changes to the ensemble.
